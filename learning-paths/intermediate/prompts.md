These prompts assume you’ve already written a high‑level specification (PRD).  Ask the AI to generate or refine code according to your spec.

## E‑Commerce Catalog

- "Given the PRD for a simple e‑commerce site with a product list, product detail pages and a checkout page, scaffold the project and suggest initial database models."

## Chat App

- "Based on the YAML spec defining a real‑time chat app with rooms and private messages, generate the front‑end and back‑end scaffolding and explain where to add authentication."

## Todo Application PRD
