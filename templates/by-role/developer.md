## ‚ö° Performance Optimization

```
Optimize this React application for performance:

Current issues:

2. Memoization with useMemo and useCallback
3. Virtual scrolling for long lists
4. Image optimization (lazy loading, WebP format)
5. Bundle analysis and tree shaking
6. Debouncing search input
7. Caching API responses
8. Service worker for offline support

Provide before/after metrics and explain each optimization technique.

## üí° Tips for Developers

**When using these templates:**
1. Replace placeholder tech stack with your preferences
2. Add specific business logic requirements
3. Specify error handling needs
4. Include performance requirements
5. Request code comments and documentation

**Make prompts better by adding:**
- "Follow SOLID principles"
- "Include TypeScript types"
- "Add JSDoc comments"
- "Include unit tests"
- "Follow [framework] best practices"
- "Make it production-ready"

**For complex projects:**
- Start with architecture design prompt
- Then use specific component prompts
- Request code reviews
- Ask for refactoring suggestions
