# Universal Practices

This file collects best practices that apply to all projects in the **Vibe Coding Resources** repository.  Following these guidelines will help keep your code secure, maintainable and welcoming to newcomers【68158416498129†screenshot】.

## Version Control Workflow

* **Commit early and often** – Capture incremental progress with descriptive messages so you can roll back if necessary.
* **Branch per feature** – Use short‑lived feature branches and open a pull request when you are ready for review【246647353490186†screenshot】.
* **Review AI suggestions** – Always review code generated by AI in pull requests before merging to ensure quality and security【246647353490186†screenshot】.

## API Key Security

* Never commit secrets or API keys to your repository.  Store them in a `.env` file and list that file in `.gitignore`【246647353490186†screenshot】.
* Provide sample `.env.example` files so others know which keys to set.
* Rotate keys regularly and revoke any keys that may have been exposed.

## Documentation Standards

* Write documentation in Markdown (`.md`) files alongside your code.
* Update README files whenever you add or modify a feature so future developers understand the project structure【68158416498129†screenshot】.
* Use clear section headings, short paragraphs and lists to make docs easy to read.

## Contribution Guidelines

* Be respectful and inclusive.  We follow the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) as our code of conduct.
* Fork the repository or create a branch, then open a pull request against `main` with your changes.
* Include context, reasoning and references in your PR description so reviewers understand why the change is needed.
* Run any provided tests and lints before submitting a PR.

By adhering to these practices you ensure your vibe coding projects remain secure, organized and ready for collaboration【68158416498129†screenshot】.
