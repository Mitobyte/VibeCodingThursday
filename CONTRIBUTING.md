# Contributing Guide

Thanks for taking the time to contribute!  This project is built around vibe coding best practices.  Please follow these steps when adding new material or making improvements.

1. **Discuss changes first.**  Open an issue or start a discussion outlining what you’d like to add or change.
2. **Fork and branch.**  Fork the repository or create a new branch from `main`.  Use a descriptive branch name (e.g. `feature/new-prompts`).
3. **Add your work.**  Create or edit files.  Place beginner materials under `BEGINNER/`, intermediate materials under `INTERMEDIATE/`, advanced materials under `ADVANCED/` and universal guidelines at the root.
4. **Write documentation.**  Update or create README and prompts files so that others understand your contributions.
5. **Commit and push.**  Commit your changes with a clear message.  Push the branch to your fork or to this repository if you have permissions.
6. **Open a Pull Request.**  Submit your pull request against `main`, describing what you’ve done and referencing any relevant issues.  Make sure you’ve addressed feedback and followed the [Universal Practices](UNIVERSAL-PRACTICES.md) guidelines before requesting review.

We appreciate all contributions and strive to make this repository a welcoming place for learners and developers.
