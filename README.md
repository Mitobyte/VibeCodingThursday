## What is Vibe Coding?

**Vibe coding** is a modern programming approach where you describe applications in plain English and let AI assistants generate working code. This methodology:

- Opens software development to creators of all skill levels
- Lets you focus on product vision and user experience instead of syntax
- Accelerates prototyping and iteration cycles
- Maintains professional code quality through AI-assisted best practices

By offloading boilerplate and implementation details to AI, you can concentrate on what matters most: building great products.

## Quick Start

### 1. Choose Your Level

- **Beginner?** Start with browser-based tools (no installation required)
- **Intermediate?** Try spec-driven development with GitHub workflows
- **Advanced?** Dive into CLI tools for maximum control

### 2. Set Up Your API Key

Most tools use [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) for AI capabilities:

1. Sign up at [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)
2. Generate an API key
3. Add it to your chosen tool's settings
4. Keep it secure in a `.env` file (see [UNIVERSAL-PRACTICES](docs/UNIVERSAL-PRACTICES.md))

### 3. Pick a Starting Project

Browse [example prompts](docs/prompts.md) or try these:

- **Blog**: "Build a basic blog with posts and comments"
- **Tracker**: "Create a mobile app that tracks daily mood"
- **Portfolio**: "Make a portfolio website with project showcase"

---

## Learning Paths

### Beginner: Web-Based Tools

**Best for:** First-time builders, rapid prototyping, no local setup

Start with browser-based platforms that handle all configuration:

- **[Replit + Ghostwriter](https://replit.com)** - Full browser IDE with integrated AI
- **[Lovable](https://lovable.dev)** - Polished designs without detailed instructions
- **[v0 by Vercel](https://v0.dev)** - Technical breakdowns with animated previews

**Learn more:** [levels/BEGINNER/README.md](levels/BEGINNER/README.md)

### Intermediate: Spec-Kit Development

**Best for:** Structured workflows, requirement-driven development, team projects

Move beyond ad-hoc prompts with GitHub Spec-Kit:

1. Write a Product Requirements Document (PRD) in YAML/Markdown
2. Feed specifications into scaffolding systems
3. Use AI completions via OpenRouter to iterate
4. Gradually refine front-end and back-end components

**Learn more:** [levels/INTERMEDIATE/README.md](levels/INTERMEDIATE/README.md)

### Advanced: CLI Programming

**Best for:** Experienced developers, fine-grained control, production systems

Command-line tools for AI pair-programming:

- **[Cursor CLI](https://cursor.sh)** - File-level refactoring and testing
- **[Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code)** - Codebase understanding and Git automation
- **[Aider](https://aider.chat)** - Terminal-based pair programming

**Learn more:** [levels/ADVANCED/README.md](levels/ADVANCED/README.md)

## Best Practices

### Version Control
- Commit early and often with descriptive messages
- Use feature branches for all development
- Review AI-generated code before merging

### Security
- Never commit API keys or secrets
- Use `.env` files and proper `.gitignore`
- Rotate keys regularly

### Documentation
- Write in Markdown alongside code
- Update READMEs when adding features
- Use clear headings and short paragraphs

**Full guidelines:** [docs/UNIVERSAL-PRACTICES.md](docs/UNIVERSAL-PRACTICES.md)
