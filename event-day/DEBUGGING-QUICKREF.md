## üö® Most Common Errors

### Error: "Syntax Error" or "Unexpected Token"

**What it means:** Missing parenthesis, bracket, or quote

**Quick fix:**
1. Check for matching pairs: `( )`, `[ ]`, `{ }`, `" "`
2. Look at the line number in the error
3. Ask AI: "Fix this syntax error: [paste error message]"

**Example:**
```javascript
// ‚ùå Wrong
console.log("Hello;

// ‚úÖ Right
console.log("Hello");
```

---

### Error: "Cannot read property of undefined"

**What it means:** Trying to use data that doesn't exist yet

**Quick fix:**
1. Check if data is loading
2. Add optional chaining: `data?.property`
3. Add a check: `if (data) { ... }`

**Example:**
```javascript
// ‚ùå Wrong
const name = user.name;

// ‚úÖ Right
const name = user?.name || "Guest";
```

---

### Error: "Failed to fetch" or "Network Error"

**What it means:** API call isn't working

**Quick fix:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify API key is correct
3. Check if API URL is right
4. Look for CORS issues

**Ask AI:**
```
My fetch request is failing with this error: [ERROR].
Here's my code: [PASTE CODE]
How do I fix it?
```

---

### Error: "Module not found" or "Cannot find module"

**What it means:** Missing dependency or wrong import path

**Quick fix:**
```bash
# Install the missing package
npm install [package-name]

# Or if using different tool:
yarn add [package-name]
```

**Check import:**
```javascript
// ‚ùå Wrong
import Button from './components/Button';

// ‚úÖ Right (if file is Button.jsx)
import Button from './components/Button.jsx';
```

---

### Error: Nothing appears on screen

**What it means:** Component not rendering or hidden

**Quick fix checklist:**
- ‚òê Is the component imported?
- ‚òê Is it used in the JSX?
- ‚òê Check CSS (is it `display: none`?)
- ‚òê Check console for other errors

**Ask AI:**
```
My component isn't showing up on the screen.

## üåê Browser-Specific Fixes

### Page is blank / white screen

**Check:**
1. Open browser console (F12 or Cmd+Option+J)
2. Look for red error messages
3. Common causes:
   - JavaScript error preventing render
   - Wrong file path
   - Missing HTML element with id

**Quick fix:**
```
Ask AI: "My page is blank. Console shows: [ERROR]"
```

---

### Styles not applying

**Check:**
1. Is CSS file imported?
2. Are class names spelled correctly?
3. Is there a typo in the CSS?
4. Check browser dev tools "Elements" tab

**Quick fix:**
```javascript
// Replit: Make sure style.css is linked in index.html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

// React: Import the CSS
import './App.css';
```

---

### Button clicks don't work

**Check:**
1. Is onClick handler attached?
2. Is function defined?
3. Check console for errors

**Example fix:**
```javascript
// ‚ùå Wrong
<button onClick="handleClick()">Click</button>

// ‚úÖ Right (React)
<button onClick={handleClick}>Click</button>

// ‚úÖ Right (Vanilla JS)
<button onclick="handleClick()">Click</button>
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Tool-Specific Issues

### Replit Problems

**Issue: "Out of memory" or app is slow**
- **Fix:** Click "Stop" then "Run" again to restart

**Issue: Changes not showing**
- **Fix:** Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

**Issue: Ghostwriter not working**
- **Fix:** Check if you're in free tier limit, try rephrasing prompt

**Issue: Can't install package**
- **Fix:** Use the Packages tool in sidebar, not terminal

---

### Lovable Problems

**Issue: Can't deploy**
- **Fix:** Check if you're at free project limit (3 projects)

**Issue: Database not working**
- **Fix:** Verify Supabase connection in settings

**Issue: Design changes not applying**
- **Fix:** Click "Regenerate" instead of editing directly

---

### v0 Problems

**Issue: Code doesn't work when copied**
- **Fix:** Copy the entire component, including imports

**Issue: Styles look different**
- **Fix:** Make sure Tailwind CSS is installed in your project

**Issue: Can't use the component**
- **Fix:** v0 generates components, not full apps - you need to integrate them

## üöë Emergency Fixes

### "Everything broke and I don't know why"

**Nuclear option (saves you every time):**
```bash
# If using Git (recommended!)
git status
git diff  # see what changed
git checkout -- .  # DANGER: reverts all changes!

# Or restore from last working commit
git log
git checkout [COMMIT_HASH]
```

**If not using Git:**
- Use your tool's history/undo feature
- Replit: Click "History" button
- VS Code: Ctrl+Z repeatedly

---

### "API key not working"

**Check:**
```javascript
// Is it actually loaded?
console.log("API Key:", process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY);

// Did you restart after adding .env file?
// Many tools require restart to load env variables
```

**Common mistakes:**
- Typo in variable name
- Forgot to add to .env file
- Forgot to restart dev server
- Using wrong variable prefix (REACT_APP_, VITE_, etc.)

---

### "Can't commit to Git"

```bash
# See what's wrong
git status

# Common fix: stage files first
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"

# If commit fails due to large files
git rm --cached [large-file]
```

## üÜò Still Stuck?

### At the Event:
1. **Ask an organizer** - that's what they're there for!
2. **Pair up** - two heads are better than one
3. **Show your screen** - visual debugging is faster
4. **Take a break** - fresh eyes see errors

### Outside the Event:
1. **Google the exact error** - someone else had it
2. **Ask on Discord/Slack** - community channels
3. **Check tool's documentation** - might be a known issue
4. **Start fresh** - sometimes easier to rebuild

## üéì Learn from Errors

**Good mindset:**
- Errors are learning opportunities
- Everyone gets errors (even experts!)
- Each error teaches you something
- Debugging makes you better

**Bad mindset:**
- "I'm bad at coding"
- "This should just work"
- "AI should do everything perfectly"
- "I'll never figure this out"

**Remember:** Professional developers spend 50% of their time debugging. It's a normal part of coding!
