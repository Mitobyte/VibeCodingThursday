# Beginner Level

The beginner section is for people new to vibe coding.  Instead of struggling with local installs or configuration, start with web‑based platforms that handle all the setup for you【733157614509169†screenshot】.  At this level you’ll describe your idea in plain English and let an AI assistant scaffold the code in the browser.

## Recommended Tools

* **Replit + Ghostwriter** – A browser IDE that supports OpenRouter API keys.  After signing up, paste your API key in the AI settings and ask Ghostwriter to build your app【733157614509169†screenshot】.
* **Lovable** – Generates polished UI designs without detailed prompts.  Great for beginners who want something pretty fast【733157614509169†screenshot】.
* **v0 by Vercel** – Shows you how features are constructed and animates the generated code.  Be aware that the free plan has limited credits【733157614509169†screenshot】.

## Getting Started

1. Pick one of the tools above and create a free account.
2. Obtain an OpenRouter API key if required and add it to the tool’s settings.
3. Use one of the sample prompts from the `prompts.md` file to start generating your first web app.

All tools support exporting the code to GitHub so you can continue working locally later【733157614509169†screenshot】.
