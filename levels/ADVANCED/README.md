# Advanced Level – CLI Workflows

At the advanced level you’ll switch to command‑line tools for the most control.  Pair programming environments like **Cursor CLI** and **Copilot CLI** let you issue file‑specific instructions and integrate with your local development workflow【246647353490186†screenshot】.

## Key Practices

* **Use feature branches** – Create a new branch for each task and review AI suggestions through pull requests before merging【246647353490186†screenshot】.
* **Manage secrets** – Add a `.gitignore` file and use `.env` to store API keys and other secrets【246647353490186†screenshot】.
* **Automate testing and security** – Ask the AI to expand your CI pipeline to run tests and security scans, and post results back to GitHub【246647353490186†screenshot】.

These tools integrate seamlessly with OpenRouter API configurations and can even help you generate Docker Compose setups for full‑stack projects.
