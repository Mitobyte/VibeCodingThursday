# Intermediate Level – Spec‑Kit Development

After building a few apps with beginner tools, step up to **GitHub Spec‑Kit** for more structured projects.  At this level you’ll move beyond simple prompts and create requirement‑driven applications.

## Workflow Summary

1. **Write a Product Requirements Document (PRD)** – Use YAML or Markdown to define each page, feature and component【614663201524371†screenshot】.
2. **Feed the spec into the scaffolding system** – The AI will generate an initial codebase based on your PRD【614663201524371†screenshot】.
3. **Iterate with AI completions** – Use your OpenRouter API key to refine and extend the generated code structure【614663201524371†screenshot】.

Tools like v0 by Vercel help you understand database migrations and SQL changes during the build process.  Remember to set up a GitHub repository early, manage your API keys with `.env` files, and commit your progress regularly【614663201524371†screenshot】.
