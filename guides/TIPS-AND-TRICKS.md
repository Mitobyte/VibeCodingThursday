## Prompt Engineering Mastery

### The Anatomy of a Great Prompt

**Structure:**
```
[Role/Context] + [Task] + [Requirements] + [Constraints] + [Output Format]
```

**Example:**
```
You are an experienced React developer. Create a reusable button component that:
- Accepts label, onClick, and disabled props
- Supports three variants: primary, secondary, outline
- Includes loading state with spinner
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Includes TypeScript types

Output the component code with PropTypes documentation.
```

### Specificity Levels

**Too Vague:**
```
❌ "Make a website"
```

**Better:**
```
✅ "Create a landing page for a coffee shop"
```

**Best:**
```
✅✅ "Create a responsive landing page for a coffee shop including:
- Hero section with background image and call-to-action
- Menu section displaying coffee drinks with prices
- About section with shop history
- Contact form with name, email, message fields
- Mobile-responsive navigation
Use Tailwind CSS and vanilla JavaScript"
```

### Iterative Refinement Pattern

**Step 1: Scaffold**
```
"Create a todo list application with React"
```

**Step 2: Enhance**
```
"Add the ability to mark todos as complete with strikethrough styling"
```

**Step 3: Extend**
```
"Add categories for todos (Work, Personal, Shopping) with color coding"
```

**Step 4: Polish**
```
"Add localStorage persistence so todos survive page refresh"
```

**Step 5: Production-Ready**
```
"Add error boundaries and loading states for better UX"
```

### Context Management

**When to Include Context:**
- Building on existing code
- Maintaining consistency with patterns
- Following specific frameworks or libraries
- Adhering to style guides

**How to Provide Context:**
```
"Given this existing authentication system [paste relevant code],
add password reset functionality that:
- Sends reset email via existing email service
- Creates secure reset token with 1-hour expiry
- Follows the same validation pattern as registration
- Uses the same error handling approach"
```

### Advanced Prompt Patterns

**Specification-First Approach:**
```
"First, analyze this feature request and create a technical specification including:
1. Data models and relationships
2. API endpoints and contracts
3. Component hierarchy
4. State management approach

Then implement the specification."
```

**Test-Driven Prompting:**
```
"Write Jest tests for a user registration function that should:
- Validate email format
- Require password length >= 8
- Check for password confirmation match
- Return validation errors

Then implement the function that passes these tests."
```

**Constraint-Based Development:**
```
"Implement a shopping cart system with these constraints:
- Must work without external dependencies (vanilla JS)
- Total bundle size under 10KB
- Supports IE11 compatibility
- No localStorage (use cookies only)
- Accessible to screen readers"
```

### Prompt Templates by Task Type

**New Feature:**
```
Create [feature name] that allows users to [user goal].

Requirements:
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]
- [Requirement 3]

Technical Stack: [framework/library]
Existing Patterns: [how similar features work]
Edge Cases: [special scenarios to handle]
```

**Bug Fix:**
```
Debug and fix this issue: [describe problem]

Current Behavior: [what's happening]
Expected Behavior: [what should happen]
Steps to Reproduce: [how to trigger the bug]

Relevant Code: [paste code]

Requirements:
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Add tests to prevent regression
- Document the root cause
```

**Refactoring:**
```
Refactor [component/function name] to [improvement goal].

Current Code: [paste code]

Goals:
- Improve [performance/readability/maintainability]
- Extract [reusable logic]
- Follow [design pattern]

Constraints:
- Do not change public API
- Maintain 100% test coverage
- Keep bundle size under [X KB]
```

**Documentation:**
```
Generate comprehensive documentation for [code/API/component].

Include:
- Purpose and overview
- Usage examples (basic and advanced)
- API reference with parameters and return values
- Common pitfalls and troubleshooting
- Performance considerations

Audience: [junior developers/API consumers/contributors]
```

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### 1. Over-Reliance on AI Without Understanding

**Problem:** Accepting AI-generated code without reviewing or understanding it

**Consequences:**
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Maintainability problems
- Difficulty debugging

**Solution:**
```
✅ Always review generated code line-by-line
✅ Ask AI to explain complex sections: "Explain how this authentication logic works"
✅ Test edge cases manually
✅ Run security and performance audits
✅ Document your understanding in comments
```

### 2. Vague Prompts Leading to Generic Code

**Problem:** "Make a website" → Generic, unusable output

**Solution:**
```
✅ Use the 5W framework:
   - What: Exact feature/functionality
   - Why: Purpose and user benefit
   - Who: Target audience
   - Where: Platform/environment
   - hoW: Technical constraints and preferences

Example: "Create a mobile-responsive portfolio website [WHAT]
for a freelance photographer [WHO] to showcase their work and attract clients [WHY].
Must work on iOS Safari and Android Chrome [WHERE].
Use Next.js with Tailwind CSS, optimize images for web [HOW]."
```

### 3. Not Managing API Keys Securely

**Problem:** Hardcoding API keys or committing them to repositories

**Solution:**
```bash
# ✅ .env file (never commit this)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-your-key-here
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost/db

# ✅ .env.example (commit this)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key_here
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost/dbname

# ✅ .gitignore (always include)
.env
.env.local
.env*.local
```

### 4. Ignoring Generated Tests

**Problem:** AI generates tests, but they're never run or maintained

**Solution:**
```
✅ Run tests immediately after generation
✅ Integrate into CI/CD pipeline
✅ Fix failing tests before moving forward
✅ Add tests to your iteration cycle:
   Code → Test → Review → Refine → Repeat
```

### 5. Feature Creep in AI Conversations

**Problem:** Starting with "simple login form" and ending with "enterprise auth system with OAuth, 2FA, and biometrics"

**Solution:**
```
✅ Define MVP scope upfront
✅ Create new conversations for new features
✅ Use "parking lot" pattern:
   "Note: Will add OAuth in future iteration. For now, focus only on email/password."
```

### 6. Not Version Controlling Progress

**Problem:** Making many AI-suggested changes without commits

**Solution:**
```bash
# ✅ Commit after each successful iteration
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication with email/password"

# ✅ Use feature branches
git checkout -b feature/user-auth

# ✅ Tag working versions
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "MVP with basic auth working"
```

### 7. Copy-Paste Without Adaptation

**Problem:** Using AI-generated code designed for different context or framework version

**Solution:**
```
✅ Verify framework version compatibility
✅ Check if dependencies are already in your project
✅ Adapt naming conventions to match your codebase
✅ Ask: "Adapt this code to work with React 18 and my existing auth context"
```

### 8. Overwhelm from Too Many Tool Options

**Problem:** Trying to use 5 different tools simultaneously

**Solution:**
```
✅ Start with ONE tool for 2 weeks minimum
✅ Master the basics before switching
✅ Evaluate tools based on:
   - Your skill level
   - Project type
   - Team familiarity
   - Integration requirements
```

---

## Workflow Optimization

### Daily Workflow Template

**Morning (Planning Phase - 30 min)**
```
1. Review yesterday's AI-generated code
2. Identify today's 3 priority tasks
3. Write clear prompts for each task
4. Set up feature branch: git checkout -b feature/task-name
```

**Development (Iteration Phase - 2-3 hours)**
```
1. Start with scaffold prompt
2. Review and test generated code
3. Iterate with refinement prompts
4. Commit working increments frequently
5. Take breaks every 50 minutes
```

**Afternoon (Integration Phase - 2 hours)**
```
1. Integrate AI-generated components
2. Manual testing and edge case verification
3. Code review and refactoring
4. Documentation updates
```

**End of Day (Review Phase - 30 min)**
```
1. Run full test suite
2. Document what was learned
3. Plan tomorrow's prompts
4. Push to remote repository
```

### Context Switching Optimization

**Problem:** Losing context when switching between tasks

**Solution:**
```
✅ Use separate terminal sessions per project
✅ Keep conversation history organized by feature
✅ Write README-DAILY.md with current context:
   - What you're working on
   - Current blockers
   - Next steps
   - Relevant file paths
✅ Use git stash for WIP when switching:
   git stash push -m "WIP: auth middleware"
```

### Batch Similar Tasks

**Efficient:**
```
✅ "Generate unit tests for these 5 utility functions: [list]"
✅ "Update all components in src/components/ to use new Button component"
✅ "Add TypeScript types to all API route handlers"
```

**Inefficient:**
```
❌ Testing one function at a time across 5 separate prompts
❌ Updating components individually across 10 conversations
❌ Adding types file-by-file over several days
```

### Parallel Development Tracks

**Use AI for boilerplate while you focus on unique logic:**

```
Track 1 (AI): Generate CRUD operations for User model
Track 2 (You): Design complex business logic algorithm
Track 3 (AI): Create responsive UI components
Track 4 (You): Integrate third-party payment API

Then merge tracks systematically
```

### Effective Context Management

**Project Context File Pattern:**

Create `AI-CONTEXT.md` in project root:
```markdown
# Project Context for AI Assistance

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React 18, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL
- Auth: JWT with httpOnly cookies
- Deployment: Vercel (frontend), Railway (backend)

## Code Patterns
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- Error handling: try/catch with custom error classes
- API responses: {success: boolean, data: any, error: string}

## Current Architecture
[Brief description or diagram]

## Active Files
- src/auth/middleware.js - Current focus
- src/components/Dashboard.jsx - Needs refactoring
- tests/integration/auth.test.js - Expanding

## Known Issues
- [Issue 1]
- [Issue 2]
```

Reference in prompts: "Given context in AI-CONTEXT.md, implement..."

## Debugging Strategies

### When AI-Generated Code Fails

**Step-by-Step Debugging:**

**1. Read the Error Message**
```
✅ Copy full error stack trace
✅ Identify the specific line causing issue
✅ Check for typos in AI-generated code
```

**2. Isolate the Problem**
```
✅ Comment out sections to find failing part
✅ Test components individually
✅ Use console.log strategically (not everywhere)
```

**3. Ask AI for Help (Properly)**
```
❌ "It doesn't work, fix it"

✅ "This function throws 'TypeError: Cannot read property name of undefined':
[paste function and error stack]

The error occurs when: [describe scenario]
I expect: [expected behavior]
I'm getting: [actual behavior]

Debug and fix this issue."
```

**4. Verify Assumptions**
```
✅ Check that dependencies are installed
✅ Verify environment variables are loaded
✅ Confirm API endpoints are correct
✅ Test with simple, known-good inputs first
```

### Progressive Debugging Pattern

**Level 1: Console Debugging**
```javascript
// ✅ Strategic logging
console.log('Auth middleware input:', req.headers);
console.log('Token after parsing:', token);
console.log('User from database:', user);
```

**Level 2: Debugger Statements**
```javascript
// ✅ Pause execution to inspect
debugger; // Browser DevTools will pause here
```

**Level 3: Unit Test Debugging**
```javascript
// ✅ Isolate with tests
test('should parse valid JWT token', () => {
  const token = 'valid-token-here';
  const result = parseToken(token);
  expect(result).toBeDefined();
  expect(result.userId).toBe('123');
});
```

**Level 4: AI-Assisted Root Cause Analysis**
```
"Analyze this failing test and explain:
1. Why it's failing
2. What the code is trying to do
3. What assumption is incorrect
4. How to fix it properly

[Paste test code and error]"
```

### Common AI Code Issues

**Issue 1: Missing Dependencies**
```
Error: Cannot find module 'package-name'

Solution:
npm install package-name
# Or check package.json to verify it's listed
```

**Issue 2: Wrong Import Paths**
```javascript
// ❌ AI might generate
import { Button } from './components/Button';

// ✅ Should be (check actual structure)
import { Button } from '../../components/Button';
```

**Issue 3: Async/Await Misuse**
```javascript
// ❌ AI might generate
const data = getUserData(); // Missing await
console.log(data); // undefined or Promise object

// ✅ Should be
const data = await getUserData();
console.log(data); // Actual data
```

**Issue 4: State Management Confusion**
```javascript
// ❌ AI might generate
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
setCount(count + 1); // Might not work in rapid succession

// ✅ Should be
setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1); // Functional update
```

### Debugging Prompts Library

**General Debugging:**
```
"Debug this code. It should [expected behavior] but instead [actual behavior].
Error message: [error]
[Paste code]"
```

**Performance Issues:**
```
"This component is slow when [scenario]. Profile and suggest optimizations:
[Paste component]"
```

**Logic Errors:**
```
"This calculation produces wrong result. When input is [X], output is [Y], but should be [Z].
Trace through the logic and fix:
[Paste function]"
```

## Tool-Specific Tips

### Replit + Ghostwriter

**Power User Tips:**
```
✅ Use Cmd/Ctrl + K for inline AI suggestions
✅ Select code and ask "Explain this" for learning
✅ Use "Generate" command for boilerplate
✅ Always Secrets tab for API keys, never .env in public repls
✅ Use .replit file to configure run command
```

**Ghostwriter Prompt Optimization:**
```
# Instead of multiple small requests:
❌ "Add button"
❌ "Make it blue"
❌ "Add click handler"

# Single comprehensive request:
✅ "Add a blue button with onClick handler that alerts 'Clicked!'"
```

### Lovable

**Credit Conservation:**
```
✅ Plan features fully before generating
✅ Use "Regenerate" sparingly - review first
✅ Export to GitHub early, continue locally
✅ Use for initial scaffold only, refine elsewhere
```

**Best Use Cases:**
```
✅ Client presentation prototypes
✅ Design exploration and mockups
✅ Landing pages and marketing sites
❌ Complex business logic (too expensive)
❌ Large multi-page applications (credit drain)
```

### v0 by Vercel

**Maximizing Value:**
```
✅ Use technical breakdown feature to learn patterns
✅ Copy database schema SQL for your own migrations
✅ Study component composition strategies
✅ Export early when credit limit approaches
✅ Use for learning React/Next.js patterns
```

**Prompt Pattern:**
```
"Create [component] with these requirements:
[List requirements]

Show me:
1. Component code
2. Required database schema
3. API route implementation
4. TypeScript types"
```

### Cursor IDE

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**
```
Cmd/Ctrl + K: AI inline edit
Cmd/Ctrl + L: Open AI chat
Cmd/Ctrl + I: AI instruction mode
Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + K: Generate code
```

**Multi-File Refactoring:**
```
✅ Select files in sidebar
✅ Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + K: "Refactor selected files to use..."
✅ Review changes in diff view before accepting
```

**Codebase Chat:**
```
✅ "@codebase" reference to search entire project
✅ "@file" to reference specific file
✅ "@folder" to reference directory

Example: "@codebase where is user authentication implemented?"
```

### Claude Code CLI

**Git Automation:**
```bash
# ✅ Auto-generate commits
claude-code commit

# ✅ Interactive PR creation
claude-code pr create

# ✅ Code review
claude-code review --files src/auth/

```

---

## Integration & Deployment

### Local to Production Workflow

**Phase 1: Local Development**
```bash
# AI generates code locally
# Test thoroughly with:
npm test
npm run lint
npm run build
```

**Phase 2: Staging Deployment**
```bash
# Deploy to staging first
git push origin staging
# Automated CI/CD runs tests
# Manual QA on staging URL
```

**Phase 3: Production Deployment**
```bash
# Merge to main after approval
git checkout main
git merge feature/new-feature
git push origin main
# Production deployment automated
```

### Environment Configuration

**Development vs Production:**

```javascript
// ✅ config.js pattern
const config = {
  development: {
    apiUrl: 'http://localhost:3000',
    debug: true,
    mockData: true
  },
  production: {
    apiUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL,
    debug: false,
    mockData: false
  }
};

export default config[process.env.NODE_ENV];
```

### API Integration Tips

**Start with Mocks:**
```javascript
// 1. Generate mock API first
const mockUserAPI = {
  getUser: async (id) => ({
    id,
    name: 'Test User',
    email: 'test@example.com'
  })
};

// 2. Build UI with mock
// 3. Replace with real API later
// 4. Keep mock for testing
```

**Prompt for API Integration:**
```
"Create API service layer for User operations:
- GET /api/users/:id
- POST /api/users (create)
- PUT /api/users/:id (update)
- DELETE /api/users/:id

Include:
- Error handling with try/catch
- TypeScript types
- Request/response validation
- Token authentication header
- Loading states
- Mock implementation for testing"
```

### Database Migrations

**Safe Migration Pattern:**
```
✅ Generate migration script with AI
✅ Review SQL carefully (no DROP TABLE in prod!)
✅ Test on development database first
✅ Backup production before running
✅ Run during low-traffic window
✅ Have rollback script ready
```

**AI Migration Prompt:**
```
"Generate PostgreSQL migration scripts for:

UP migration (apply changes):
- Add 'email_verified' boolean column to users table (default false)
- Create index on users.email for faster lookups
- No data loss

DOWN migration (rollback):
- Remove email_verified column
- Drop email index

Include transaction wrapper and error handling."
```

## Performance & Efficiency

### Code Optimization Prompts

**General Optimization:**
```
"Review this code for performance issues and suggest optimizations:
[Paste code]

Focus on:
1. Time complexity (Big O)
2. Memory usage
3. Unnecessary re-renders (React)
4. Database query efficiency
5. Network request reduction"
```

**React Performance:**
```
"Optimize this React component for performance:
[Paste component]

Implement:
- useMemo for expensive calculations
- useCallback for function props
- React.memo for pure components
- Code splitting where appropriate
- Lazy loading for heavy components"
```

### Bundle Size Management

**Analysis Prompt:**
```
"Analyze this package.json and suggest:
1. Unnecessary dependencies to remove
2. Heavy packages with lighter alternatives
3. Tree-shaking opportunities
4. Code splitting strategies

Current bundle size: [X KB]
Target: [Y KB]"
```

### Caching Strategies

**AI-Generated Caching:**
```
"Implement caching for this API endpoint:
[Paste endpoint]

Requirements:
- Cache in Redis with 5-minute TTL
- Invalidate cache on data updates
- Handle cache misses gracefully
- Add cache hit/miss logging"
```

---

## Security Best Practices

### Security Review Prompt

```
"Perform comprehensive security audit of this code:
[Paste code]

Check for:
1. SQL injection vulnerabilities
2. XSS attack vectors
3. CSRF protection
4. Authentication bypass possibilities
5. Authorization logic flaws
6. Sensitive data exposure in logs/errors
7. Insecure dependencies
8. Rate limiting needs

Provide specific fixes for each issue found."
```

### Input Validation

**Always Validate:**
```
"Generate input validation for this API endpoint:
[Paste endpoint]

Validate:
- Email format
- Password strength (min 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, number)
- Required fields
- Data types
- Max length limits
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS prevention

Use Joi schema validation."
```

### Authentication & Authorization

**Secure Auth Prompt:**
```
"Implement JWT authentication with:
- Access token (15 min expiry)
- Refresh token (7 day expiry, httpOnly cookie)
- Password hashing with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- Token rotation on refresh
- Logout with token blacklist
- CSRF protection

Include error handling and security headers."
```

## Learning & Improvement

### Learning from AI Code

**Code Explanation Pattern:**
```
1. Generate code with AI
2. Ask: "Explain this code line by line as if teaching a beginner"
3. Ask: "What are alternative approaches?"
4. Ask: "What are the trade-offs of this approach?"
5. Ask: "What could go wrong with this code?"
```

### Building Knowledge Base

**Personal Prompt Library:**

Create `prompts/` directory in your projects:
```
prompts/
├── authentication.md
├── database-migrations.md
├── react-components.md
├── api-endpoints.md
└── testing.md
```

Each file contains proven prompts for that domain.

### Measuring Progress

**Weekly Review Questions:**
```
1. What patterns did AI teach me this week?
2. Which generated code did I have to fix?
3. What prompts worked best?
4. What did I learn about the tech stack?
5. Can I now implement [X] without AI help?
```

### Transitioning to Independent Development

**Gradual Independence:**
```
Week 1-2: AI generates everything
Week 3-4: You modify AI output significantly
Week 5-6: You write outline, AI fills details
Week 7-8: You write code, AI reviews
Week 9+: You write independently, AI for specific tasks only
```

---

## Quick Reference

### Emergency Troubleshooting

**Code Won't Run:**
```
1. Check error message carefully
2. Verify all dependencies installed
3. Check environment variables loaded
4. Review recent changes (git diff)
5. Ask AI with full error context
```

**AI Gives Wrong Code:**
```
1. Check if you provided enough context
2. Verify framework versions match
3. Break request into smaller prompts
4. Try rephrasing the prompt
5. Ask AI to explain its approach first
```

**Stuck on Problem:**
```
1. Take a 10-minute break
2. Explain problem to rubber duck (or AI)
3. Search for similar issues online
4. Ask AI for different approach
5. Reach out to community
```
